  "timelineExplanationText": "Our classification system is a true celebration of your dedication! Every task completed, every goal achieved, and every step taken towards fluency is an opportunity to earn points and shine! We have two types of scoring: the MONTHLY SCORE, which is reset every new month, and the TOTAL SCORE, which accumulates over time. Each month, we highlight the leaders of the monthly score, offering exclusive discounts or extra classes as a reward, and monitor the total progress of each student, propelling them to new levels of fluency. It's not just a competition; it's an exciting journey towards linguistic excellence!",
